# Stacks

- A stack is a linear, dynamic data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. The last item to be inserted into a stack is the first one to be removed.
- Elements can only be deleted from one end of the stack and this end is called `top` of the stack.
- Inserting a new element to a stack is called `push` and removing an element from the stack is called `pop`.

# Complexity Analysis

| Push      | O(1) - Constant Time |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| Pop       | O(1) - Constant Time |
| Peek      | O(1) - Constant Time |
| Searching | O(n) - Linear Time   |
| Size      | O(1) - Constant Time |
